\section{Conclusion}
There are different approaches to dealing with \textit{DeepFakes}.
We consider methods of detection to be only one part of a possible solution since
on their own it would possibly only lead to a race between creating and discovering
networks which are constantly improving each other.
Here we agree with the authors of the servey that out of band methods for 
signatures of multimedia content is required for a better solution.

Also we would dissagree with the idea \textit{DeepFakes} are particullary easy to create.
Even though there are multiple projects like FaceSwap which aim at making the
process as accessible as possible, there is still the requirement of a decently 
powered computer, time and access to the proper video/picture footage.\todo{Creation conclusion}
