\section{Conclusion}
There are different approaches to dealing with \textit{DeepFakes}, some more
promessing than others.
We consider methods of detection to be only one part of a possible solution since,
on their own, they would possibly only lead to a race between \glspl{nn} for
the creation and for the detection of \textit{DeepFakes}, both getting more and
more sophisticated. In this aspect, we agree with~\textcite{mirsky_creation_2020}'s ideas that 
out-of-band methods for signatures of multimedia content and other prevention
mechanisms are required for a better solution.
However, a sole focus on technical solutions to the challenges arising from the 
existance and spread of \textit{DeepFakes} might also be futile. More effective
might be to, at the same time, try to adapt on a legal and society level to this
new situation, being aware of the existance of possibly false media content.
