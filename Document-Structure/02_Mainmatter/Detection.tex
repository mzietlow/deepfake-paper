\section{Detection of DeepFakes}
We will focus on the detection of DeepFakes, even though there is also some research in the area of
prevention.

\subsection{Artifact-Based Approach}
The algorithms for creating DeepFakes might introduce artifacts in the resulting images.
These artifacts can be used to discover DeepFakes and lay the foundation for this type of detection.

\subsection{Undirected Approaches}
In this approach, the focus is not on the artifacts, but on training gerneric neural networks, which can decide by themself on relevant
features which inform about whether or not an image is fake.

\subsection{Research}
When researching DeepFake detection, there is the challenge of having high quality data sets to train and test models on\cite{li_celeb-df_2019}.
