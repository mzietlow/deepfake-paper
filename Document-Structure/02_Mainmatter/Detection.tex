\section{Detection of DeepFakes}
We will focus on the detection of DeepFakes, even though there is also some research in the area of
prevention.

\subsection{Artifact-Based Approach}
The algorithms for creating DeepFakes might introduce artifacts in the resulting images.
These artifacts can be used to discover DeepFakes and lay the foundation for this type of detection.

\subsection{Undirected Approaches}
