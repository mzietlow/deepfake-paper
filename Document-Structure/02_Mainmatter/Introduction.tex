\section{Introduction}
Some introductory words.

\subsection{Structure}
Firstly some background information will be given. These will contain, among 
other things, a quick overview over ethical challenges arrising from the missuse
and spread of DeepFake technology.
This is followed by an overview of the creation of many-to-many DeepFakes.
Based on this there is a presentation of different approaches to combat DeepFakes.

\subsection{Limitations}
This paper will limit its scope, content outside of this scope might be subject
of later study.
The focus will be on many-to-many DeepFakes of visuals and their detection.
This means that DeepFakes of text or audio signals will not be part of this work.
Furthermore we will not speak about one-to-one or one-to-many deepfakes, since
we consider the
many-to-many DeepFakes to be of a greater risc because of their more generic
nature and larger applicability.
