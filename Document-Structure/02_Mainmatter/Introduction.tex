\section{Introduction}
Some introductory words.

\subsection{Structure}
Firstly some background information will be given. These will contain, among 
other things, a quick overview over ethical challenges arrising from the missuse
and spread of DeepFake technology.
This is followed by an overview of the creation of many-to-many DeepFakes.
Based on this there is a presentation of different approaches to combat DeepFakes.

\subsection{Limitations}
This paper has a limited scope, allowing for further studies of its contents.
The focus will be on many-to-many DeepFakes of mimics and their detection.
This means that DeepFakes of text or audio signals will not be part of this work.
Furthermore, the topics of one-to-one and one-to-many DeepFakes will not be
dealt with. This is because we consider many-to-many DeepFakes to be of greater
risk due to their more generic nature and larger applicability.
